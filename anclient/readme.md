Assist.Network Test Client
==========================

This is the test (demo) implementation of the Assist.Network client. It demonstrates
API 1.0 functionality and features the unique, natural-languge proposal system for
easy and quick entry of items.

This project, while not essentially closed-source, is of little value to outsiders.
When the Assist.Network project launches, its resources will probably be shared, but
not at this repo.
